This repository contains the final code for a game of chess that is played between 2 live players. It can be run on any IDE that supports Python. 
I have made use of the Graphics library of Python to create the GUI, and used 2-dimensional lists to keep track of the positions of pieces on the board.
The behavior of different pieces is implemented in separate well-defined methods.
Concepts such as recursion are implemented to provide a user experience to the player that mimics a real-time chess game (for example, a player might click on a piece, decide not to play it, and then play another.
Note: This is my first personal project. I worked on this during the winter of my first-year, after my introductory Computer Science course (CS 130).
